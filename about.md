<p>
I am currently a CSE pre-final undergraduate at <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/" target="_blank">IIT KGP</a>.I am a open-source enthusiast and love doing cp.I am passionate about learning new technologies and implementing them. I am an avid reader and love exploring stuff beyond their limit. I love dancing though I am not good at it XD.
 
An interesting feature about me is that I just can't stop myself from over-eating pasta.It is not a normal pasta but it needs to a mixed one with red  white sauce both with an extra cheese  and the last but most important is that it needs to be extremely spicy. Spicy enough to make  water run out of one's nostrils lol.

I am excited to meet people and share their ideas with a cup of coffee :)
