#TRUST
  Have you encountered situations when you want to trust someone but just cannot? When your heart says that the person is trustworthy but at the same time your mind refrains you from doing saying that you are bound to be hurt again. You start remembering the time when you were happy and too gullible to trust and love anyone. It wasn’t a long time ago, but you’ve grown a lifetime.But it's still scary and daunting to trust people.
Why does this happen?Why are we too scared to trust anyone,to betray our heart again?

It takes courage to love and trust someone with all your heart and soul,but once you have been broke ,there is no going back .
 There are moments when you want to forgive ,forget the past and not think the wrong doings.You are even ready to forget the pain,mental trauma of getting over them but you don't.You want  make the mistake of choosing them over yourself,again.But you choose yourself this time and it feels liberating!

Those scars were too deep to be filled so easily.But they will heal soon.
And when they will you will no longer be afraid of trusting people and giving the a chance again.You will grow stronger .The past will stop resurfacing again and again.The future will seem bright and refulgent . The poisonous breeze of past will no longer influence your present and future decisions.
