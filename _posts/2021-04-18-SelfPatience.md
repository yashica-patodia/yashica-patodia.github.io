>*"Dont give your mind the power to control your heart."*

A few days before, I had quite a philosophical and introspecting conversation with my friend.It was how we can and rather should respond to dull and emotional moments like heartbreaks in our life.


Heartbreak denotes a phase where trust and love ,the two most important attributes that you can have for a person is completely shattered. It requires no rocket science to realize that this phase of your life is difficult to deal with. But still we tend to be so hard on ourself,for having the emotions and feelings which are perfectly natural. We blame ourselves for feeling the way we are .  We held ourselves responsible for falling in love or trusting the other person. But this is absolutely wrong!
We need to realize that it wasn't our fault to have let the other person into our life.It was something that felt correct then but doesn't seem now. And that is perfectly natural! There is nothing we can do about it.
Change is the only constant thing ,and it perfectly fine if your feelings change due to some actions of theirs or some events which was rather not supposed to happen.


But humans don't know how to deal with this situations. We try to talk it out with our friends . 
But finding people who would actually listen to your rant is difficult. On a personal experience,  I know many people whom I can call friends.
But in moments like these I find myself lonely and detached from them.
I realize that would be least interested in knowing my story .
It would rather lead to a waste of their time.Nothing changes afterward. We continue to have the same thoughts and experience the same pain.
Talking about these emotions starts to seem gloomy with no positive and constructive outcome.
We convince ourselves that we can't change anything neither can anyone as well. 
We are perplexed and lost and can't seem to figure out what we should try to do to bring back the same state of mind.



Somehow we mutter the courage to contact the person responsible for this weird. Even contacting the person numerous times doesn't seem to bring the inner peace and happiness that we earlier experienced.
We tend to choose the other person again and again. This only makes us more dependent and vulnerable to them. We need to learn to choose ourself .This will make us more liberated and hence more confident.


It is in such moments of guilt ,pain and sadness that we need to have self-patience and heel ourselves with time.

>*So in the words of my friend  " It is Patience and Pain we choose."*
