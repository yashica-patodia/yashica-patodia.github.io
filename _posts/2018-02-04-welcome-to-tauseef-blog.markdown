# Who am I?
Hi, I am `Yashica Patodia`, a *sophomore* at *IIT Kharagpur* enrolled for a B-Tech course in the field of Computer Science and Engineering from Calcutta, India .I am an open source enthusiast and love doing competetive programming as well.
 

I was born in Calcutta, India.

# What is this site about?
Starting a blog and creating an online presense, to share my learnings was always on my todo list. Finally today I decided to start doing it.
I want to use this site as a place to share my experiences with interesting programing problem solving, hoping someone will benefit from the findings.
It also delves into some philosophical questions of life .More to say 2:AM thoughts Xd.
