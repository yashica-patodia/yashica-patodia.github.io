## Making FRNDS
Making friends and hanging around with people was never my cup of tea. I have always found myself not being able to mingle with people so easily.
It is not similar to being *introvert* rather it is something more inclined to one's own preferences and frame of mind. Having said this, I don't know how many of you can relate 
with this but for me friendship is something much more *special* and *sublime* than being in any relationship.

So ,I ended up eventually making a person my so-called *best-friend* when I was in class 10 but ended up being completely disappointed and kinda lost trust in friendship,
when I realized that the person whom I considered my *best-friend* had since that time been always judging me based  on my certain attributes which the person found disgusting.

### Cutting the story short
The whole point of referencing to that incident was  just to prove that it happens sometimes that we perceive certain people as someone in our mind but it is actually not who they are
in reality! We end up having a completely different version of a person in mind, and create whole new future stories based on that perception which is **incorrect**.
>"I am not responsible for your version of me in your mind"
These certain aspects in our life just makes me wander that does *LOVE* truly exists ,apart from the love from our family?
