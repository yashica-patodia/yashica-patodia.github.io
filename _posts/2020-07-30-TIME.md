Being able to *work* from home amidst the cacophony of daily noise is definitely not a easy task!  

Being lethargic and pro-castinate tasks is something we all are prone to.It is indeed worth probing that earlier when we hardly had the required time (jostling between classes,events ,extracurricular)we still were being able to complete those tasks !

But now when we have ample time at our disposal we just waste it on social media or binge watching series in Netflix,Hotstar Amazon prime and **WHAT NOT!**
We do realize that *TIME* was never the problem ! It was just the willingness to learn something new and grow as an individual everyday.
Now given the situation we just find ourselves lacking that curiosity  altogether.
