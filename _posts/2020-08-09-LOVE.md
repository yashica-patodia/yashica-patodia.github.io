Have you guys ever fallen in *love*? 

But did you had the courage to face that person and express your *feelings*? Did you had the guts to acknowledge the your potential *vulnerability* of needing that person?
Did you have the confidence to share your fall-outs and fallacies with the person in return of no  judgement and fear of letting down your self -esteem?


## VULNERABILITY
Lets  not make things hard for ourselves! The questions raised above have been raged in the minds of millenials galore. We do find ourselves vulnerable to our *innate* *emotions*.

The feeling when you realize when you have fallen head over heels for that person and need his presence more than anyone is definitely not empowering.You feel no-longer independent.
You seem to be pre-occupied by their thoughts ,actions and almost everything about them.You have to share your *TIME* with them.The time which you could have actually invested on your 
self is now *their's*.

These thoughts prevent us from expressing our feelings in the first place.The fact that you might have to place that person before your self-interest bothers your mind more than any other 
question.

## FEAR OF REJECTION AND JUDGEMENT
The second train of thoughts which prevents us from from expressing our feelings is the *Fear* of rejection! What if the other person does'nt feel the same way?What if the other person
doesnt consider us worthy  enough? Or maybe we are not just worthy enough for them?? What if our  attributes are not *liked* by the person?

If any of these happen to be true we would just end up making a fool out of ourself and the prior friendship which we shared would also be contaminated!!

The thought that horrifies me the most before commiting to someone is that what if I am being judged by the person for my idiosyncracies?We definitely don't want to be judged by people 
who we *LOVE*,*TRUST* and *CARE* for. **DO WE?**

>*"It is better to be friends with the person you like rather than date the person."*
