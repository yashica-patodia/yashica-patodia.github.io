Heyy peeps,have you guys ever fallen in *love*? I am sure you must have :P

But did you had the courage to face that person and express your *feelings*? Did you had the guts to acknowledge the your potential *vulnerability* of needing that person?
Did you have the confidence to share your fall-outs and fallacies with the person in return of no  judgement and fear of letting down your self -esteem?


##VULNERABILITY
Lets  not make things hard for ourselves! The questions raised above have been raged in the minds of millenials galore. We do find ourselves vulnerable to our *innate* *emotions*.

The feeling when you realize when you have fallen head over heels for that person and need his presence more than anyone is definately not empowering.You feel no-longer independent.
You seem to be pre-occupied by their thoughts ,actions and almost everything about them.You have to share your *TIME* with them.The time which you could have actually invested on your 
self is now *their's*.

These thoughts prevent us from expressing our feelings in the first place.The fact that you might have to place that person before your self-interest bothers your mind more than any other 
question.

##FEAR OF REJECTION AND JUDGEMENT
The second train of thoughts which prevents us from from expressing our feelings is the *Fear* of rejection! What if the other person does'nt feel the same way?What if the other person
doesnt consider me worthy  enough? Or maybe I am not just worthy enough for him?? What if my certain attributes are not *Liked* by the person?

If any of these happen to be true I would just end up making a fool out of myself and the prior friendship which we shared would also be contaminated!!

The thought that horrifies me the most before commiting to someone is that what if I am being judged by the person for my idiosyncracies?We definately dont want to be judged by people 
whom we *LOVE*,*TRUST* and *CARE* for.

>*"It is better to be friends with the person you like rather than date the person."*
